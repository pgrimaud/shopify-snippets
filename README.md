# Shopify Snippets

Useful .liquid snippets for Shopify themes

## Why this repository?

I developed several Shopify websites from scratch, without all-made themes.

Last websites I worked on : 

- [https://paulandjoe.com/](https://paulandjoe.com/) for [Tribord Digital](https://triborddigital.com/)
- [https://anashaf.com/](https://anashaf.com/) for [Tribord Digital](https://triborddigital.com/)
- [https://hubside.store/](https://hubside.store/) for [Big Youth](https://www.bigyouth.fr/)
- [https://www.statement.paris/](https://www.statement.paris/) for [Big Youth](https://www.bigyouth.fr/)
- [https://www.caravane.fr/](https://www.caravane.fr/) for [Big Youth](https://www.bigyouth.fr/)

As a back-end developer, I needed to created "ready to use" parts of code which can be reusable. That's the content of this repository.
